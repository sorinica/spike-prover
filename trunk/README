(* Sorin Stratulat - April 2013 *)

The `trunk' directory contains the following information:

- README - this file
- sources directory - the SPIKE sources. To create `spike_bc', run `make' in the directory (you need ocaml installed).
- specs directory - the SPIKE specification files. The files related to the ABR proof are in the 'abr' subdirectory. Simpler examples are in the 'basic' subdirectory.

NEW: we have added two subdirectories to the `abr' directory: 1) the `rm' subdirectory has ABR conjectures that can be proved using a reasoning module combining a semi-decision procedure for linear arithmetic and a congruence closure procedure, and 2)  the `no_rm' subdirectory has ABR conjectures that can be proved without the reasoning module. The proof for a spec file <file.spike> can be launched with '../../../sources/spike_bc <file.spike>'.

- Coccinelle directory - It allows to certify the implicit induction proofs issued by SPIKE with Coq (see below). However, the `dracula'- and the `reasoning module'-based proofs cannot be certified in this version.
 
The proofs using the DRaCuLa strategy can be automatically launched with the shell script prove.sh from the `dracula' subdirectories. The output is stored in the .tmp files.

Similarly, examples of certified proofs are given in the `certify' directories. They contain a shell script, validate.sh, that automatizes the certification process for you. Before running the script, you should:

1. compile Coccinelle  (you need COQ installed. Any version 8.4 should work.). This is an adapted version from http://raweb.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2010/proval/uid44.html
2. enter the `sources' directory and compile with the command "make" to generate spike_bc (you need Ocaml installed).  
3. to automatically run and test the specifications of the SPIKE files, run `validate.sh -spec'.
4. to automatically run and test the proofs of the SPIKE files, run afterwards `validate.sh' without parameters. (step 4 is compulsory).

To setup the path to Coccinelle, here is an example of the file .coqrc from your home directory

Add LoadPath "<path_to_spike_prover>/trunk/Coccinelle/basis".
Add LoadPath "<path_to_spike_prover>/trunk/Coccinelle/list_extensions". 
Add LoadPath "<path_to_spike_prover>/trunk/Coccinelle/term_algebra". 
Add LoadPath "<path_to_spike_prover>/trunk/Coccinelle/term_orderings".
