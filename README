(* Sorin Stratulat - February 2024 *)

To compile Spike, go to the "sources" directory and follow the instructions from the README file

The "specs" directory contains :
 - the  "basic" subdirectory for proving some simple examples. It contains:
     - the "examples" subdirectory with the examples
     - the "dracula" subdirectory. Launch 'prove.sh' to generate the proofs using the Dracula strategy and described in
       @inproceedings{Stratulat:2012uq,
	address = {Manchester},
	author = {S. Stratulat},
	booktitle = {Turing-100 (The Alan Turing Centenary Conference)},
	editor = {A. Voronkov},
	pages = {326-352},
	publisher = {EasyChair},
	series = {EPiC Series},
	title = {A Unified View of Induction Reasoning for First-Order Logic},
	volume = {10},
	year = {2012}}
     - the "certified" subdirectory. Launch "validate.sh" to generate the proofs to be checked by Coq.
 - the "ABR" subdirectoy for examples about the certification of a telecommunications protocol, described in
        @article{Rusinowitch:2003ak,
	author = {M. Rusinowitch and S. Stratulat and F. Klay},
	journal = {Journal of Automated Reasoning},
	number = {2},
	pages = {153-177},
	title = {Mechanical Verification of an Ideal Incremental {ABR} Conformance Algorithm},
	volume = {30},
	year = {2003}}
        It contains:
        - the "dracula" subdirectory. Launch 'prove.sh' to generate the proofs using the Dracula strategy.
        - the "rm" subdirectory. Launch 'prove.sh' to generate the proofs using reasoning modules for linear arithmetic and congruence closure
        - the "no_rm" subdirectory. Launch 'prove.sh' to generate the proofs without using reasoning modules
        - the "certified" subdirectory. Launch "validate.sh" to generate proofs and the Coq scripts from the proofs.
- the "preambule_coq" subdirectory with Coq files required during the validation process

The proof from the "certified" subdirectory can be certified using Coq and the Coccinelle and CoLoR libraries. Coq should be installed. The  CoLoR and Coccinelle libraries, available for different versions of Coq (> 8.3), are installed in the "theories" subdirectory.

- run 'config.sh <Coq version>' to set the Coq version.
- run 'make' to validate the Coq scripts.
